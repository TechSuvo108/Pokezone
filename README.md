## 🌐 Overview

<p>
  <em>
    <b>PokéZone</b> is a simple Pokémon-themed website created during my early
    learning phase of <b>Bootstrap</b>.  
    The main goal of this project was to understand how Bootstrap helps in
    building <b>responsive</b>, <b>structured</b>, and <b>visually appealing</b>
    webpages without writing custom CSS.
  </em>
</p>

<p>
  <em>
    This project focuses purely on using <b>Bootstrap classes and components</b>
    such as navbar, modals, carousel, cards, grid system, and utilities.
